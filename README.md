# Bank Customer Churn Analysis

This project involves analyzing and predicting customer churn for a bank using a dataset of 10,000 customer records. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the implementation of three machine learning models: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.

## Overview

- **Objective:** To predict whether a customer will churn (exit) using various features.
- **Dataset:** Contains information on customers including CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumberOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary, and Exited.

## Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Models Used

- Random Forest
- Decision Tree

## Performance Metrics

- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Support

## Instructions

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
2. **Model Training:** Training the models with the preprocessed data.
3. **Evaluation:** Evaluating model performance using various metrics.

## File Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset file.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
